Observable Trends in the data

1: The First observable trend is that at least 84% of players on this game identify themselves as men. These men also appear to generate the most revenue for Pymoli. If we were to overalp the genders and the age range, I predict that we would see the most revenue coming from Males aged between 20-24 as they would be in College and would play the game instead of studying or working on their projects. Knowing how much time they spend on the game and what quests they complete with what items could help to market more items.

2: Per person, those who are in the age ranges of 35-39, less than 10, and 20-24, spent the most money in that respective order. There have been 41 purchases in the 35-39 range, 23 total purchases in the less than 10 range, and 365 total purchases in the 20-24 age range. The 20-24 age range showed to have the most purchases to any age group, this makes sense since they are the most dominant age group.

3: On item analysis, all of them items that are popular and profitable are on both tables. They have at least 8 purchases to their name and the top 4 on each table show to have a Total Purchase Value of at least $31. The reason why they are populare and profitable is relatively unknown from the data since they do not have stats associated to the item. We do not know what kind of items they are to begin with. Are they healing items, weapons, armour, or special items that have add stats buffs to the character.

Overall, this was an interesting challenge that was manageable and did require going over the material and an extensive amount of googling.
